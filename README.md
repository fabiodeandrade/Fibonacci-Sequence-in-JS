### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
I created this repo to show my logic to Fibonacci sequence and futuraly refactor with new features from javascript
 
 
### How about the logic?

First of all i needed to read a human function to fibonacci sequence.

>>The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.
 
After that i needed to translate this to javascript world. firstly i think about the params of the function: `totalNumberOfSequence`, a array to get this params and transform to your length `fibArray`.

I give the first and second index from `fibArray` to initiate the sequence; create a logic loop to get a sequence from the third index and add a new number in array with fibonacci logic.

` fibArray[i] = fibArray[i - 2] + fibArray[i - 1]`

 
 
### ðŸ”§ Next steps
 
- Refactoring with new javascript features
